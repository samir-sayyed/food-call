   // Before
   <img src={RES_IMG_URL + cloudinaryImageId} />
   
   // After
   <img 
     srcSet={`${RES_IMG_URL}/w_400/${cloudinaryImageId} 400w,
              ${RES_IMG_URL}/w_800/${cloudinaryImageId} 800w`}
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 400px, 800px"
     loading="lazy"
     alt="Restaurant"
   />
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -1.2s LCP, -1.5MB page weight

2. **Enable Brotli Compression** (Priority: High)
   - Configure Parcel to output Brotli-compressed assets
   - Set up server to serve `.br` files with proper headers
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -600KB transfer size, -0.4s load time

   // Split all routes like Instamart
   const About = lazy(() => import('./components/About'));
   const RestaurantMenu = lazy(() => import('./components/RestaurantMenu'));
   const Cart = lazy(() => import('./components/Cart'));
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -400KB initial bundle, -0.8s TTI

2. **Optimize Component Rendering** (Priority: High)
   ```javascript
   // Wrap expensive components
   export default React.memo(RestaurantCard);
   
   // Memoize filtered data in Body.js
   const filteredRestaurants = useMemo(() => 
     restaurants.filter(res => res.info.avgRating > 4),
     [restaurants]
   );
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -300ms interaction time, smoother scrolling

3. **Add Redux Selector Memoization** (Priority: Medium)
   ```javascript

   const selectCartTotal = createSelector(
     state => state.cart.items,
     items => items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0)
   );
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -50ms re-render time

---

### 3. CSS & Rendering Performance

#### Issues Found

**🟡 HIGH: Cumulative Layout Shift (0.15)**

- No purge configuration optimized

#### Recommendations

1. **Fix Layout Shifts** (Priority: High)
   ```javascript
   // Add dimensions to images
   <img 
     className="w-full h-48 object-cover"
     width="400"
     height="300"
     src={imageUrl}
   />
   
   // Reserve space for header
   <header className="sticky top-0 h-16 bg-white">
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: CLS from 0.15 to 0.05 ✅

2. **Optimize Tailwind Build** (Priority: Medium)
   - Update `tailwind.config.js` with proper purge paths

     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           // Only keep used colors
           blue: { 100: '#...', 300: '#...' },
           green: { 50: '#...', 200: '#...' }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **Expected Improvement**: -30KB CSS size

### 4. Core Web Vitals Analysis

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 3.1s ⚠️

**Root Causes**:
1. Large hero restaurant images loading slowly (2.1s)
2. JavaScript blocking rendering (0.8s)
3. No resource prioritization

**Fixes**:
- Add `<link rel="preload">` for critical images
- Implement image optimization (see Network section)
- Use `fetchpriority="high"` on LCP image

```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero-image.webp" fetchpriority="high">
```

**Target**: Reduce to 2.0s ✅

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): 0.15 ❌

**Root Causes**:
1. Images without dimensions (0.10 shift)
